      <h4>Preserving the Art: Caring for Your Hand-Painted Bottle</h4>

        To ensure that the hand-painted design on your bottle remains vibrant and intact, it’s important to follow a few care guidelines:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Handle with Care:</strong> Treat the bottle gently to avoid scratches or damage to the paint. Avoid rough handling or placing the bottle in situations where it might get knocked over.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoid Extreme Temperatures:</strong> Keep the bottle away from extreme heat or cold, as this can affect both the paint and the beverage inside. Store the bottle in a cool, dry place to preserve its quality.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clean Carefully:</strong> If you need to clean the bottle, use a soft, damp cloth to gently wipe the surface. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that could damage the paint.
